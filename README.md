# SGPA-Calculator
SGPA Calculator using Tkinter and MySQL Integration


This project aims to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based SGPA calculator using Python programming language and Tkinter library. The application takes inputs such as name, registration number, semester, department, and subject-wise grades from the user and calculates the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) based on the grading system of the university.

The project uses a MySQL database to store the information entered by the user. The data is stored in a well-organized manner that facilitates easy retrieval and manipulation of data. The database can store a large amount of data, which makes the application suitable for use in universities and colleges.

The GUI design of the application is intuitive and user-friendly, which makes it easy for users to interact with the application. The application also provides features such as adding, editing, and deleting student records, and generating reports based on the stored data.

Overall, this project provides a simple and effective solution to calculate SGPA for university students. It also demonstrates the use of programming languages and databases to develop real-world applications.
